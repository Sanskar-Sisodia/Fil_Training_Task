Hello I am Paritosh. Your Java code has multiple issues that need fixing:

Errors & Fixes:
Syntax Errors:

The try block is not enclosed within a method (like main).
FileOutputStream f1; is declared but not initialized inside try.
Variables should be declared inside the method.
Logical Errors:

f1.write((char)i); should be f1.write(i); (no need to cast char).
FileOutputStream f2 is opened for writing again ("a.txt"), which overwrites the file instead of reading it.
The do-while loop for counting lines reads i, but i is never updated in the second loop.
